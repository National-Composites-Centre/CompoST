Requirements
============


Pydantic
--------

Pydantic library has been selected for better management of Python classes, including its interoperability with JSON format. https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/models/ . The library is used for all object definition within CompoST.


CAD system
----------
Having a CAD system is NOT a hard requirement but it is highly complimentary to most foreseen use-cases.

Storing of basic CAD models (surfaces, solids) is already covered by well documented STEP format.

Therefore this data does not fit under CompoST, where the appropriate CAD file is merely referenced for positioning of plies etc.
