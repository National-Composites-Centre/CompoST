0.71a
-----
The main developments of 0.71 are the edge-of-ply tolerenaces and defects, along with corresponding edge-of-part definition.

This version also allow for explicitely stating the status of defect, to help distinuguish between simple variation measurments and defect
that does not fit within tolerance.

Unified 'SplineRelimitation' objects - now they are available both as object and integer for all 'CompositeElement' objects.

Removed obsolete 'map' parameter from 'Defect'.
