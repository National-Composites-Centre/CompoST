On the figure above, arrows point from an object 1 to object 2, where object 1 inherits from object 2.

The figure is also work-in-progress. The outline titled "mostly fixed" houses the objects that have been implemented and used. These will hopefully see only minor adjustments. Objects outside this area might end up being standardised differently than currently suggested.

All fields are optional unless otherwise specified, or unless required to construct specific object.

Where the same attribute is being called in parent and child (e.g. axis being referenced in ply, and in some of corresponding cut pieces), the more detailed (child) component supersedes the corresponding parent definition.


CompositeDB object is the main object of the Composite Standard. All objects are stored in lists named all***.  

Object definitions
------------------
	
.. py:function:: CompositeStandard.CompositeDB(BaseModel)

	All elements and all geometry are all stored here and used elsewhere as refrence
	Points are stored withing those, as referencing is not efficient
	
	BaseModel input signifies the default generation with Pydantic library, without any local parent.
	
	:param name: str - name
	:param allComposite: list - List of CompositeElement type objects
	:param allEvents: list  - List of "events" objects - all = exhaustive list
	:param allGeometry: list - List of "GeometricElement" objects - all = exhaustive list
	:param allStages: list - List of "Stages", all stages where CompoST file is edited (manufacturing, NDT, simulation...)
	:param allMaterials: list - List of "Material" objects - all = exhaustive list
	:param allDefects: list - List of "Defect" objects - should contain all, that are referenced elsewhere
	:param allTolerance: list - List of "Tolerance" objects 
	:param fileMetadata: 'FileMetadata' - metadata for this CompoST file
	:param allSimulations: list - List of "SimulationData" objects

	:param author: str - initial part definition created by
	:param version: str - version of the CompoST used to work with this file
	:param layupDefinitionVersion: str - initial part layup definition generated by 
	:param cadFile: str - related CAD file, if references to geometries are required, .step format is recommended. Should be stored in same folder.
	:param toolCadFilePath: str - only used if tool has separate CAD file from the above
	:param maxID: int - maxium ID used for any object int the file, used for preventing duplicaiton of IDs
	:param cadFilepath: str - should only be used when CAD could not be stored in same folder as this file
	
	
.. py:function:: CompositeStandard.CompositeDBItem(BaseModel)

	:param memberName: str - name
	:param additionalParameters: dict - to hold use-case specific values (to be further defined). This should never hold copies of IDed objects, as these cannot be re-linked on deserialization. If reference to objects elsewhere in CompoST are required, ID reference should be used, not full object.
	:param stageIDs: int - reference to Stage object
	:param deactivate_stageID: int - this object is not relevant after this stage, either it has been superceeded or it's purpose was fullfilled
	:param active: boolean - on default "True", can be turned "False" to indicate this is no longer representative of up-to-date part
	:param ID: int - used for references between objects

.. py:function:: CompositeStandard.SimulationData(CompositeDBItem)

	This is abstract class, parent for various types of simulations.
	
	:param axisSystem: 'AxisSystem' - reference to axis system 
	:param sourceSystem: `SourceSystem` - the software or tool used for analysis
	:param cadFile: str - path and name to CAD file
	:param toolCadFile: str - path and name to CAD file for tool (if different)

.. py:function:: CompositeStandard.GeometricElement(CompositeDBItem)
	
	:param source: str - the software, script, or database that this object originated from
	:param refFile: str - reference full name of dedicated file housing this geometry (assume same directory)
	
.. py:function:: CompositeStandard.CompositeElement(CompositeDBItem)

	This includes any object that is used to describe composite component specifically.
	
	:param subComponent: list - :py:meth:`~CompositeStandard.CompositeDBItem.get` , either as object or ID
	:param requirements: list - list of objects of Requirement type, to be further specified
	:param defects: list - list of "defects" type objects

	:param manufMethod: `ManufMethod` - manufacturing method object 
	
.. py:function:: CompositeStandard.Point(GeometricElement)

	:param x: float 
	:param y: float
	:param z: float
	
.. py:function:: CompositeStandard.Line(GeometricElement)

	:param points: list - list of two points , no more - no less
	:param length: float - can be calculated from above, but can be stored to prevent calculation duplication
	
	
.. py:function:: CompositeStandard.AxisSystem(GeometricElement)
	
	The three vectors listed bewow must be perpendicular to each other.
	
	:param o_pt: `CompositeStandard.Point` - origin location of axis system expressed in global axis system
	:param x_pt: `CompositeStandard.Point` - point, (x_pt-o_pt) denoting x-vector of new axis system
	:param y_pt: `CompositeStandard.Point` - point, (y_pt-o_pt) denoting y-vector of new axis system
	:param z_pt: `CompositeStandard.Point` - point, (z_pt-o_pt) denoting z-vector of new axis system (this one is auto-calculated)
	
	There were 3 main core requirements for definition of Axis System. It should be possible to write out reasonably simple axis system by user,
	without any calculations. Minimum number of values should be used for initial full definition of the axis system (8). The perpendicularity of
	the 3 axis should be enforeced without user participation.
	
	The class definition automatically calculates z_pt, when this object is initialized or altered.
	
	If y_pt made axis is not perpendicular to x_pt made axis, y_pt is recalculated using z_pt. User is encouraged to specify first 2 axis perpendicular
	to each other. However, if user fails to do so the object adjusts itself (at least when using the standard CompoST library in Python).
	
	User cannot set z_pt on it's own. Upon any changes this is recalculated from x_pt, y_pt and o_pt.
	
.. py:function:: CompositeStandard.Material(CompositeDBItem)
